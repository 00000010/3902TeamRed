Comments on code readability:
The code is readable and it is easy to identify the main purpose of the command. The execute function can be split up into seperate functions based on the type of item to enhance code readability. Another solution can be to put the items in a dictionary and pick out the functionality from the dictionary based on the item.

Comments on code maintainability: 
The code is maintanable and has low coupling. The code can benefit from having some comments to describe the functionality within each branch in the code. That being said, the names used for functions and objects help clarify exactly what's happening which also helps with maintainability if future fixes are needed. 
Hypothetical change: An additional change could be to have the map in the inventory effectively update according to the location of the player instead of having it be static.
