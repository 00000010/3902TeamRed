Comments on code readability:
Clearly defined code chunks for individual purposes.  Comments available to increase readability.  Quite honestly there aren't a whole lot of things
to say about readability.  
Comments on code maintainability:
As the constants are changed we would need to check the appearance of the dungeon room in case changes in dimensions affect aesthetics.  As any new 
items/enemies/images become available we'd need to add them to the dictionary.  Overall everything else is pretty well abstracted.

Hypothetical change:
I feel like it would be smarter to pull prefilled dictionaries from somewhere else in the code instead of creating them in house in this file.
