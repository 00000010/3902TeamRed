CS file being reviewed: (polishing many files)
Author of file: William Gilicinski
Number of minutes: 5
Comments about readability:
Maintaining readbility by polishing up many of the files into easier to read (like more white space) and commenting out unnecassary code helps keep the whole project easier to read.

Comments about maintainability:
Keeping the code base cleaner will help the team later on maintain such code. Also Dungeon2 was a mess that didn't work so fixing the pointers to help with testing helps with maintaining everythings.

Hypothetical change:
Instead of commenting everything out, it might be better to delete some lines entirely.
