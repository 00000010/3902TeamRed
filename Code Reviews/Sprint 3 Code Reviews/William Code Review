Specific comments on code quality

As the XML format is pretty readable due to readability is not an issue. In regards to the code quality, because the XML was written manually if new objects are added to the game, this would also have to be updated manually

Hypothetical change:
Create a function that takes all the items from a list or dictionary that can output the XML
