Comments on code readability:
Overall the variable and class names are easy to get a sense of what the code is doing or is supposed to be doing; however, there are 
some sections with a long math equation that gets hard to read. Also, in the update method, it is hard to read whats going on. I think
if it was two if-else statements instead of four ifs it would be easier.

Comments on code maintainability: 
Each method is commented on what it does and it is easy to tell whats going on so maintaining doesn't seem that bad. However, on certain
variables I do not think it is a good idea to have the { get; set; } be something so different that changing functionality might break this.

Hypothetical change:
I think staying to just the normal { get; set; } on than adding in functionality to setting something through methods would be a better idea, also
the method getPosition sets the position than return a boolean. I think it should be renamed or only do one of the two.
