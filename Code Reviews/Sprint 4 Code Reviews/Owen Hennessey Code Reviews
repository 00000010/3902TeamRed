Owen Hennessey Code Reviews

Readability: Will/Room.cs
Room contains a lot of good coding practices regard readability.  There are no instances of dot chaining, the files does not know anything it
really does not need to know.  All methods serve a single purpose and there are necessary comments with complicated code.  
It is properly chunked for increased readability.

Maintainability: Abd/CollisionResolution.cs
I see some issues where the file may know too much about other things.  It also seems to me that as we add more types to the game and more functionality
that this file may require changes to handle the new additions due to it's complexity and vast use.
