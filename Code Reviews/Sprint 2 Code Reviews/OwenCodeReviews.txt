Owen Hennessey Code Reviews
9/30/22 - Sprint 2

Readability: Emil/ShootProjectileCommand.cs
In regards to the readability of Emil’s code, all code is evenly spaced and there are not many large blocks. 
She has ensured that when there are, there are comments to break it up or at least increase the understanding of the code.  
Her constructor and projectile methods are easily understandable and all variables follow naming conventions that lead to easy understanding.
She also has safeguards in her code that ensure that things are working correctly and, if they are not, alerts the user.  All around well written code following good practice.

Maintainability: Abd/GameObjectManager.cs
The only problem that I feel may arise it the constant use of “throw new “ exceptions.  
I fear the implementation may cause us problems because of all the potential for errors.  
There is hopefully a way to eliminate those in the future.  
In regard to the rest of the code, it is well written and easily understandable.
