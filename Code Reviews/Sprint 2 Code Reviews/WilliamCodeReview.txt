Specific comments on readability

The code is easily readable and all the variables use a good name that make readability easier. I appreciate that acomments are given for each of the 
functions and what their functionality is. I think the part with the worst readability, however, is in the method UpdatePosition. It isn't too bad but its hard to tell
what is being done it each if block. Perhaps adding comments to the start of each block to breifly describe what they are doing.

Specific comments on code quality

I think overall the code is easy to read and understand what is going on but I'm afraid that it is subject to some hard programming, specifially the numbers in the
random number generators are specific, maybe those can be stored as variables. Also most importantly I think the first if block in UpdateVelocity can be upgraded by
having an array or list that keeps all enemys that use Uni movement and just using if(enemyList.contains(sourceRectangle)) { updateUni... } instead of having 
many or comparators. This will make updating the code easier.

Hypothetical change:
Lets say we want the enemies to gain exagerated movement after they are hit. This would require doubling the functions such as having 'UpdateHurtKeeseMovement' and
would require a lot of work.
