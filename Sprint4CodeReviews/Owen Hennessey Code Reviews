Owen Hennessey Code Reviews

Readability: Will/LevelLoader.cs
In regards to the readability of Willâ€™s code, the code is smart.  It uses techniques like embedding string variables into hard coded 
strings that just make his work stand out.  There are clear comments at every turn and he uses naming convention that is clean and and 
names that make sense.  All in all he doesn't really leave anything to the imagination and when you read his code there is no question 
as to its purpose.  I do however object to the use of the variable name "thing" as it is not descriptive enough for my taste.

Maintainability: Will/LevelLoader.cs
I would say this code is fairly maintainable.  Everything is well abstracted and changes in other area of the program are unlikely to cause any issues.
The only issue I could forsee is and update to the Windows operating system that makes the methods involving "OSPlatform.Windows" break but that is all.
A couple of magic numbers here and there but nothing too drastic.
